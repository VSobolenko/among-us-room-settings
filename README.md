## 🔑 Access Passwords

To make access fun and unique, a **daily password system** is used.  
The password depends on:
- **Day of the week**
- **Week number parity (even / odd)**

Here is the full schedule of passwords:

| Day        | Even Week | Odd Week |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Monday     | 4821      | 7364     |
| Tuesday    | 1957      | 8642     |
| Wednesday  | 3084      | 5271     |
| Thursday   | 6712      | 4398     |
| Friday     | 2549      | 9863     |
| Saturday   | 8437      | 1205     |
| Sunday     | 6174      | 3928     |

✅ Example:  
If today is **Tuesday** and the current week number is even → password will be **2345**.  
If it’s odd week → password will be **6789**.
